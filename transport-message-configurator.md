# TransportMessageConfigurator

## Properties

### Headers

``` c#
public List<TransportHeader> Headers { get; private set; }
```

Contains the list of name/value pair transport headers.  Whenever a `TransportMessageReceived` is set 

## Methods

### Local

``` c#
public TransportMessageConfigurator Local()
```

This sets the `RecipientInboxWorkQueueUri` tot he local inbox work queue uri.  If there is no inbox an expection is thrown.

### Reply

``` c#
public TransportMessageConfigurator Reply()
```

This sets the `RecipientInboxWorkQueueUri` to the `SenderInboxWorkQueueUri` of the transport message that was received.  This method, therefore, is only available in a [HandlerContext].  If no transport message received instance is available or if the received transport message does not have a `SenderInboxWorkQueueUri` property (the sender has no inbox) an exception is thrown.

### WithRecipient

``` c#
public TransportMessageConfigurator WithRecipient(IQueue queue)
public TransportMessageConfigurator WithRecipient(Uri uri)
public TransportMessageConfigurator WithRecipient(string uri)
```

This sets the `RecipientInboxWorkQueueUri` explicitly and no routing will be applied.

### WithCorrelationId

``` c#
public TransportMessageConfigurator WithCorrelationId(string correlationId)
```

Sets the correlation if for the message.

### Defer

``` c#
public TransportMessageConfigurator Defer(DateTime ignoreTillDate)
```

Ignores the [TransportMessage] until the given date/time has been reached.  The [TransportMessage] is sent immediately and it is up to the receiving endpoint to decide how to defer it.  It is recommended that you configure a deferred queue:

``` xml
    <serviceBus>
        <inbox
          workQueueUri="msmq://./pubsub-client-inbox-work"
          deferredQueueUri="msmq://./pubsub-client-inbox-deferred" <!-- THE DEFERRED QUEUE STORE -->
          errorQueueUri="msmq://./shuttle-samples-error" />
    </serviceBus>
```

Without a dedicated deferred queue the work queue will contain the deferred message.  This may slow down processing as a deferred message is not regarded as work.  If the queue contains too many deferred messages the queue processing will become very slow and unresponsive.

### WillExpire

``` c#
public TransportMessageConfigurator WillExpire(DateTime expiryDate)
```

The message will only remain valid until this date is reached.  After this is will not be processed but rather immediately acknowledged.  The queuing mechanism may also, should it support message expiry, remove the message internally from the queue.

### WithPriority

``` c#
public TransportMessageConfigurator WithPriority(int priority)
```

### WithEncryption

``` c#
public TransportMessageConfigurator WithEncryption(string encryption)
```

### WithCompression

``` c#
public TransportMessageConfigurator WithCompression(string compression)
```

### TransportMessageReceived

``` c#
public void TransportMessageReceived(TransportMessage transportMessageReceived)
```

This will be called by Shuttle.Esb directly.  The call will add all the received headers to the configurator headers and set the correlation id to the correlation id of the received transport message.

### HasTransportMessageReceived

``` c#
public bool HasTransportMessageReceived
```

Returns `true` if a `TransportMessageReceived` has been set for the [MessageSender] else `false`.

### TransportMessage

``` c#
public TransportMessage TransportMessage(IServiceBusConfiguration configuration)
```

This returns a new [TransportMessage] that contains the configured properties.

[MessageSender]: {{ "/message-sender" | relative_url }}
[HandlerContext]: {{ "/handler-context" | relative_url }}
[TransportMessage]: {{ "/transport-message" | relative_url }}
