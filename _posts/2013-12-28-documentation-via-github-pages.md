title: Moved documentation over to GitHub Pages
layout: post

I decided to go with GitHub Pages for our documentation.  Getting Jekyll working locally on Windows 8 was somewhat tricky but I have ended upwith a structure that I am happy with.

Initially I tried using Flatdoc and the HighlightJS for the the -orentied pages but using the templates and syntax highlighting through Jekyll and Pygments directly to produce static pages ended up being a bit simpler.

If you pick up any issues with the dccumentation please log it.  You are also welcome to fork the [Shuttle repository](https://github.com/Shuttle/Shuttle.Esb) and update the documentation before sending a pull request.
