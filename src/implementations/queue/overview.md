# Queues

The convention for queue URIs is `scheme://configuration/queue` and the `scheme` represents a unique name for the `IQueue` implementation.

Each `configuration` is a named set of options and would contain all the values required to communicate with the `queue` as well as any other bits that may be of interest.
