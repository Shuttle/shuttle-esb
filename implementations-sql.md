# Shuttle.Esb.Sql.Queue

```
PM> Install-Package Shuttle.Esb.Sql.Queue
```

Contains a sql-based `IQueue` implementation that enables a table-based queue.  Since a table-based queue is not a real queuing technology it is prudent to make use of a local outbox.

## Configuration

The queue configuration is part of the specified uri, e.g.:

```xml
<inbox
    workQueueUri="sql://connectionstring-name/table-queue"
    .
    .
    .
/>
```

<a name="Subscription"></a>

# Shuttle.Esb.Sql.Subscription

```
PM> Install-Package Shuttle.Esb.Sql.Subscription
```

Contains a sql-based `ISubscriptionManager` implementation.  The subscription manager caches all subscriptions forever so should a new subscriber be added be sure to restart the publisher endpoint service.

# Supported providers

Currently only the following providers are supported:

- System.Data.SqlClient (Sql Server)
- Npgsql (PostgreSQL - requires registration)

You are welcome to send a pull request with your own SQL database implementation.  If you'd like you may also create an issue and assistance will be provided where able.

## Npgsql (PostgreSQL)

***A big thank you*** to [Vincent Verschuren](https://github.com/hopla) for the PostgreSQL subscription implementation.

To get this working one first needs to configure the `Npgsql` `DbProviderFactory`.  This is accomplished by adding the following to the application configuration file:

``` xml
<system.data>
    <DbProviderFactories>
        <add name="Npgsql Data Provider" invariant="Npgsql" support="FF" description=".Net Framework Data Provider for Postgresql" type="Npgsql.NpgsqlFactory, Npgsql" />
    </DbProviderFactories>
</system.data>
```  

The connection string should be entered using the PostgreSQL structure and `Npgsql` as the `providerName`:

``` xml
<add name="Subscription" connectionString="Server=localhost;Port=5432;Database=ShuttleEsb;User Id=postgres;Password=password;" providerName="Npgsql"/>
```

## Configuration

The configuration section is optional as the defaults will be applied when no section is provided.

```xml
<configuration>
    <configSections>
        <section name="subscription" type="Shuttle.Esb.Sql.Subscription.SubscriptionSection, Shuttle.Esb.Sql.Subscription"/>
    </configSections>
  
    <subscription
        connectionStringName="Subscription"
        subscribe="Normal|Ensure|Ignore"
    />
  .
  .
  .
<configuration>
```

| Attribute | Default    | Description | Version Introduced |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| connectionStringName     | Subscription | The name of the `connectionString` to use to connect to the subscription store. | |
| subscribe    | Normal | Indicates how calls to the `Subscribe` method are dealt with: `Normal` is the ***default*** and will subscribe to the given message type(s) if they have not been subscribed to yet.  `Ensure` will check to see that the subscription exists and if not will throw an `ApplicationException`.  `Ignore` will simply ignore the subscription request.
| <strike>ignoreSubscribe</strike>             | false        | *Obsolete*: use the `subscribe` option. | v6.0.9 |

Whenever the endpoint is configured as a worker no new subscriptions will be registered against the endpoint since any published events should be subscribed to only by the distributor endpoint.  When using a broker such as RabbitMQ all the endpoints feed off the same work queue uri and any of the endpoints could create the subscription.

When moving to a non-development environment it is recommended that you make use of the `Ensure` option for the `subscribe` attribute since any change to the work queue uri will result in possible duplicate subscriptions.  

For any environment you could manually configure subscription using either scripts or or [Shuttle.Sentinel](https://shuttle.github.io/shuttle-sentinel/) once it becomes feasible.

The `SubscriptionManager` will register itself using the [container bootstrapping](http://shuttle.github.io/shuttle-core/overview-container/#Bootstrapping).

# Shuttle.Esb.Sql.Idempotence

```
PM> Install-Package Shuttle.Esb.Sql.Idempotence
```

Contains a sql-based `IIdempotenceService` implementation.  

There is also a subscription specific configuration section:

```xml
<configuration>
    <configSections>
        <section name="idempotence" type="Shuttle.Esb.Sql.Idempotence.IdempotenceSection, Shuttle.Esb.Sql.Idempotence"/>
    </configSections>
  
    <idempotence
        connectionStringName="Idempotence"
    />
  .
  .
  .
<configuration>
```

| Attribute | Default    | Description | Version Introduced |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| connectionStringName     | Idempotence | The name of the `connectionString` to use to connect to the idempotence store. | |

The `IdempotenceService` will register itself using the [container bootstrapping](http://shuttle.github.io/shuttle-core/overview-container/#Bootstrapping).
