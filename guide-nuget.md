# NuGet

For the most part you would need the `Shuttle.Esb` assembly in a shuttle project along with one of the queue implementation packages.  The only project that would not require any shuttle packages would be a message-only assembly.

## Add NuGet Package

![NuGet Shuttle.Esb]({{ "/assets/images/guide-nuget-1.png" | resolver_url }} "NuGet")
